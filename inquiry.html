<h1>Inquiry and Analysis</h1>
<h4>Explanation</h3>
<p> In the past decade, the majority people are living healthier lives with a higher standard of living. Since then, Many diseases that were deemed to be incurable are now harmless thanks to advancements in the medical field however, with the dusk of one issue comes the dawn of another; one regarding mental health. In the US, suicide rates have rose 25% since 1999. </p>
<h4>Justification</h4>
<p>This is predominantly technology’s fault. In the 20th century, technology has become prominent as it has many benefits. Just over 36% of people own a smartphone and of this group, around 71% of them have a social media account. Between the ages of 15-29, 80% own a smartphone and approximately 20% have experienced depression while in the 20% that do not have a smartphone, only 7% have experienced depression showing a distinct link between technology and depression which leads to suicide. To be candid, suicide rates have skyrocketed since the beginning of social media. Teens should be mindful of what they say to others online as technology has a powerful and lasting impact on mental health. In that regard, it is crucial that the government takes action promptly to resolve this problem. Evidently, suicide is a huge problem that needs to be resolved in the near future. On the WHO website, there is so much data that is useful towards suicide however, it is in a bad form of JSON which is difficult to comprehend. </p>
<h4>Target Audience</h4>
<p>Currently on the WHO website, it is in an ugly tabular form. To make it easier to read, I am going to put the data in the form of different graphs to make it more readible for teachers and students. In school, suicide is a topic taught in health class and data from the WHO website is too difficult for students to understand and teachers to teach. Putting it in a visual way such as a graph would be easier for students to learn. </p>

<h4>Research needed to complete solution to problem</h4>

<p>	While there is no crystal clear solution to suicides, there are ways to help prevent the suicide of a loved one. In order to create the solution it would require some research. The main goal to help someone would be to comfort them and convince them to rethink their decisions because ultimately, it is their choice if things are terrible for them. To begin with, basic background research regarding suicide would be needed in order to get a broad understanding of the topic. Searching up “suicide” on google and reading some articles should be sufficient. Next, the priority when talking to someone that is suicidal is to comfort them first then convince them why they should not suicide as they are important to people and people would be sad. To find this, google “comforting a suicidal”. This would find results regarding the topic. The secondary research required to find a solution would be to find out how to assess the seriousness of the situation. A well-known site, https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2017/10/03/10-things-to-say/ has questions in order to help assess the situation while calming the victim down. This site has somewhat of a solution that I would incorporate in my solution. FOr research regarding  </p>

<h4>Analysis of inspirational products (3 websites)</h4>
	
<p> Currently, my idea of a broad solution would be 2 lists, one list to help assess the seriousness of the situation and another list of how to calm and comfort the victim. There are many websites on the internet, however, I intend on creating a master list that sums all the research up into one.</p>

<p> The <b> first website </b> is <a href="https://zerosuicide.sprc.org/toolkit/identify/screening-and-assessing-suicide-risk">zerosuicide.sprc.org</a>. </p> 
	
<img src="http://newsletter.bmhutah.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ZEROSUICIDE.jpg" alt=Zerosuicide style="width:75%; ">
	
<p> This website shows the different tools used on patients to assess the situation. As a patient, you would want to get care to help handle the problem. To begin with, there are three aspects for creating a full assessment of suicide risk and providing a foundation for treatment planning. The three aspects are to gather complete information about past, recent, and present suicidal ideation and behavior, to gather information about the patient’s context and history, and to synthesize this information into a prevention-oriented suicide risk formulation anchored in the patient’s life context. The purpose of this assessment is to figure out the best treatment plan to increase safety, reduce risk, and promote wellness and recovery. From that, the main two branches are PHQ or Safe-T. PHQ or Patient health questionnaire is a brief, basic screening tool to identify at-risk patients. AN example of a brief screening would be somewhat like:</p>

<p> Over the past two weeks, have you been bothered by: <br>
1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things? <br>
2. Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? <br>
3. Thoughts that you want to kill yourself, or have you attempted suicide?</p>

<p> Medical providers can, from there, choose what treatment plan to put the patient through such as a complete assessment of suicidal thinking and behavior, including the nature and extent of the risk. </p>

<p> Safe-T offers a thorough assessment of the nature and extent of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The more extensive items contained in the SAFE-T interview are likely to yield more detailed information needed to develop a full picture of a patient’s suicide risk. The items explored are: </p>

<p> 1. Frequency, intensity, duration—in last 48 hours, past month, and worst ever <br> 2. Timing, location, lethality, availability, preparatory acts <br> 3. Past attempts, aborted attempts, rehearsals (tying noose, loading gun) vs.non-suicidal self-injurious actions <br> 4. Extent to which the patient, one, expects to carry out the plan and, two, believes the plan/act to be lethal vs. self-injurious <br> 5. Reasons to die vs. reasons to live </p>

<p> This is a more throughout assessment that can yield more detailed information that can be used to assess the seriousness of the situation. For example, the more throughout the patient has carried out how they will suicide, the more at risk they are. </p>

<p> This source gives a more broad understanding of the topic and can be used in the solution as an introduction for patients experiencing suicidal thoughts and the possible treatment plans they can start with. The source also has some key information about the full picture of a patient’s suicide risk. This material can be used to help start the list of how to assess the seriousness of the situation. In the website, I liked the banner across the top with button widgets and drop boxes. However, the page has too many words and usually, the user would be overwhelmed by the content. I would prefer more pictures and visual aids rather than text. This makes the page more visually appealing</p>

<hr>

<p>The <b>second website</b> is <a href="http://www.crisisservicescanada.ca/en/">Crisis Services Canada</a>. </p>

<img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1fa3d3_3da3834441734aa28031162daed1a6ff~mv2.png" alt=CrisisServicesCanada style="width:75%; ">

<p>This website is the crisis services of Canada that has advice for specific topics depending on the scenario. There are 4 main sub topics on the page, “Thinking about suicide”, “Someone you know thinking about suicide”, “Are you dealing with a loss from suicide”, and “Looking for local resources & support”, however, the only 2 topics with relevance to the topic are “thinking of suicide” and “Someone you know thinking about suicide”. </p>

<p>Under the “thinking about suicide” subtopic, Crisis services Canada offers a toll free helpline to chat available 24/7, an text line between 4pm and 12am ET and a Chat support line. The services are there at the victims disposal. The page has reasons why the victims should call such as “they won’t judge or dismiss their feelings. They can help the victim explore their options, understand their problems better, or just be there to listen”. The helplines provide a safe environment for victims to speak their mind. A few of the benefits include sharing their thoughts and feelings which can bring relief and reduce stress, Working through a problem can bring perspective, reduce isolation and feel empowering, and connecting with others can link the victim to resources and help find strategies to cope. The page also shows what their responders at the other end of the line will be like. Some of the positive features they will have include listening to the victims situation, providing emotional support, working through options with the victim and provide the victim with referral information for other services in their local area. Some things that responder will not do will be telling the victim what to do, judge the victim or avoid talking about tough issues. </p>

<p> The next sub category is “someone you know thinking about suicide”. This page shows the signs to watch out for to identify someone at risk. The main signs are talk or threats to harm oneself, looking for a way to kill oneself, and talking or writing about death, dying or suicide. The page also includes some of the less obvious signs such as: </p> 

<p>1. Increased substance use (alcohol or drug) <br> 2. Feelings of helplessness or hopelessness; no sense of purpose in life <br> 3. Anxiety, agitation or uncontrolled anger <br> 4. Unable to sleep or sleeping all of the time Feelings of being trapped– like there’s no way out <br> 5. Withdrawal from friends, family and society <br> 6. Acting reckless or engaging in risky activities, seemingly without thinking <br> 7. Dramatic mood changes. <br> </p>

<p> At the end of the page, it shows that people should not be ignoring the signs and instead go talk to the victim because research shows that talking about suicide does not increase the risk and in fact, connecting with someone that cares can make a difference. </p>

<p>This source is useful for my solution because it helps build ideas for the list of assessing the seriousness of the situation. In the “someone you know thinking about suicide” page, there are signs common throughout all people that help depict how serious the situation is (More signs=more serious). On this web page, the homepage is aesthetically pleasing with a nice background. There are more pictures and visuall aids than text which is better. In addition, the banner at the top of the page is nice with some dropboxes when you hover over them. I would incorporate this in my solution. Lastly, I really like the four buttons that elad to another page. They have a hover function in which when you hover over them, the buttons change to a darker tone. Overall, a nice page with lots of content under sub headings</p>

<hr>

<p>The <b>third website</b> is <a href="https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2017/10/03/10-things-to-say/">Speaking of Suicide</a> </p>

<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR8_9fvKhsCgd_lrcZ6NL4ObIEFny2jL1MwtCYEKGYft687EIhSHA" alt=Speakingofsuicide style="width:75%; ">

<p>This website has different phrases and expressions to say to a suicidal friend in order to comfort them. There are 10 different phrases with reasoning behind the choice of words based on past experiences of the author of the article. Here are 10 things you can say to someone who tells you that they are considering suicide:</p>

<p>1. “I’m so glad you told me that you’re thinking of suicide.”<br>
Often when people tell others that they’re suicidal, people react in anger and astonishment using phrases such as “Don’t be foolish”. The victim would regret telling them that they were suicidal. Using a phrase such as “I’m so glad you told me you’re thinking of suicide”, shows that you are open to thoughts regarding the topic and are there for them making them feel comforted. <br>
2. “I’m sad you’re hurting like this.”<br>
A person’s pain and loneliness can be fixed by a simple expression like this. <br>
3. “What’s going on that makes you want to die?”<br>
This phrase points to an invitation to talk about their story and shows that you really care. When they tell their story listen to them and show empathy and understanding. <br>
4. “When do you think you’ll act on your suicidal thoughts?”<br>
Asking about timing will see how serious the situation is. This will decide whether you have to call for help immediately or continue talking to them. <br>
5. “What ways do you think of killing yourself?”<br>
This is q risk-assessment question. The answer can help reveal the seriousness of the situation. A person who has put a lot of time and thought into suicide methods might be in more danger than someone with a vague wish to be dead.<br>
6. “Do you have access to a gun?”<br>
Even if this is not available to the person, this is important. If they say yes, then propose them to lock up the gun out of their reach. <br>
7. “Help is available.”<br>
By telling the person that help is available, you can help them feel less lonely and helpless. Give them a phone number to a local suicide prevention helpline. <br>
8. “What can I do to help?”<br>
This again makes them feel less lonely and helpless and shows that you are always available to them for help. <br>
9. “I care about you, and I would be so sad if you died by suicide.”<br>
This is a simple statement to show how much you care about the person. Using a phrase such as “Don’t you know I would be devastated if you killed yourself?” would heap more guilt upon the person and not comfort them. <br>
10. “I hope you’ll keep talking to me about your thoughts of suicide.”<br>
This makes it clear that they can come to you for some more help if needed. <br> </p>

<p>This source has many phrases that could be added to the master list for comforting the victim as well as the list for assessing the seriousness of the situation. This source is useful for my lists to comfort and assess the victims. It is in the form of a news article which is contrary to my of an interactive website. The page has too many words for my liking. I would put more pictures less words. THis way, the user would not be overwhelmed by the text as it has lots of content </p>

<hr>
	
<h4>Design Brief</h4>
	
<p>After doing some research of different solutions on suicide as well as visual as some research on visual aspects, I have decided to create a webpage</p>

<table>
<tr><td>
The webpage will:
	
- Include a brief introduction on the topic <br>
- Include tabular data from WHO in an interactive way <br>
- Include button widgets and graphs for the data <br>
- Include a list of questions that help people assess the seriousness of the situation of a suicidal person <br>
